In the NFL, higher offensive yardage totals lead to a higher win total.

We are going to use a scatter plot to show the correlation between total yardage for teams in the NFL and their final win total. By creating a scatterplot, we will be able to see whether or not there is a positive or negative correlation.

# Good, but you might think about using both offense and defense (i.e., yards given up) yardage to make it more interesting.
